## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS (with Tailwind Typography), [react-markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown)
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **PDF Processing**: Custom logic (see backend)

## Backend

The backend for Library Chat is available at:
[github.com/devyanic11/Library-api](https://github.com/devyanic11/Library-api)

**Setup:**
1. Clone the backend repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/devyanic11/Library-api.git
   cd Library-api
   ```
2. Follow the steps given in its readme.md

**Make sure the backend is running before starting the frontend!**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- Python 3.8+

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/devyanic11/Library-chat.git
cd Library-chat
```

### 2. Install frontend dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the frontend
```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) (or as configured in `vite.config.ts`).

## Usage
1. **Upload a PDF**: Use the upload area to select or drag-and-drop a PDF file.
2. **Wait for Processing**: The app will notify you when the PDF is ready for questions.

4. **Delete/Reset**: Click the trash icon to remove the current PDF and upload a new one.

## Project Structure
- `src/` ‚Äî React frontend components and pages
- `backend/` ‚Äî FastAPI backend (PDF processing, chat logic)
- `public/` ‚Äî Static assets

## Customization
- **Styling**: Uses Tailwind CSS. You can customize styles in `tailwind.config.ts` and `src/index.css`.
- **Markdown Rendering**: Uses `react-markdown` with Tailwind Typography for beautiful output.
- **Backend Logic**: See `backend/main.py` for PDF processing and chat logic.

## Troubleshooting
- If you get `No PDF loaded` or similar errors, make sure to wait until the PDF is fully processed before asking questions.
- If you delete a PDF, the backend is reset and you must upload a new PDF before chatting again.
- For CORS or connection issues, ensure both frontend and backend are running and accessible.
